      <p>A big brother is like a second parent, best friend, and protector all in one. From the moment you are born, he becomes your guide and shield. He teaches you how to ride a bicycle, helps with your homework, and shows you how to face life’s challenges with courage. His experiences become your lessons, and his advice often saves you from making mistakes. <br>
      <br>
      A big brother may seem strict sometimes, but it comes from a place of love. He worries about your safety, your future, and your happiness. When life feels confusing or difficult, his presence is comforting. He offers mature advice, shares his own stories, and helps you see the bigger picture.<br>
      <br>      
      Despite occasional arguments or teasing, the bond with a big brother is filled with warmth and loyalty. He supports your dreams, cheers for your victories, and motivates you when you feel low. <br>
      <br>      
      He is also your role model — someone you admire for his strength, confidence, and character. Watching him grow teaches you about responsibility, respect, and love.<br>
      <br>      
      A big brother is truly a gift — someone who walks ahead of you, not just to lead, but to make the path easier and safer.</p><br>
