        <p><b> Big Mother </b> is a figure of love, strength, and deep wisdom. She is not just a grandmother or elder woman in the family — she is the heart of the home. Her presence brings warmth, her words bring peace, and her touch feels like magic. She has seen many seasons of life and carries with her the experience of years, which she shares with gentleness and care.<br>
        <br>
        A Big Mother wakes up early, often the first one in the house, making sure everyone is well fed and cared for. She tells stories from her youth, teaches values, traditions, and sometimes even age-old remedies that modern science is still learning about. Her lap is a place of comfort, where children feel safe and loved<br>
        <br>
        She is also the silent strength of the family — someone who stands strong in tough times, gives wise advice, and holds the family together with her patience and kindness. Her love is unconditional, never expecting anything in return.<br>
        <br>        
        In every culture, a Big Mother is respected deeply, not just for her age but for her role in shaping lives. She is a living example of selfless love, sacrifice, and eternal care — someone who leaves a lasting mark on every heart she touches.</p>
