    <p>The Mother <br>

        A mother is the heart of every family. She is the first teacher, the first friend, and the strongest support in a child’s life. From the moment a child is born, a mother dedicates her life to caring, nurturing, and loving unconditionally. Her love is pure, selfless, and endless. <br>
        <br>
        Mothers are always ready to make sacrifices for their children’s happiness and future. She works day and night, sometimes without rest, just to see a smile on her child’s face. Whether she is a homemaker or a working woman, her responsibilities never end. <br>
        <br>
        A mother teaches her children values, manners, and life lessons. She is patient, kind, and understanding. In times of trouble, a mother becomes a source of comfort. Her arms are always open for a hug, her words always filled with care and hope. <br>
        <br>
        A mother plays many roles—a teacher, a doctor, a cook, a friend, and sometimes even a father. She guides with love and leads by example. Her influence shapes the personality and future of her children. <br>
        <br>
        Truly, a mother is a blessing from God. She is the light in the darkness and the strength behind every success. Her love remains with us forever.
