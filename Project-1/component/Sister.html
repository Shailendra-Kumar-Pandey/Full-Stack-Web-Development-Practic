     <p>A sister is one of the most special people in our lives. She is not just a family member but also a best friend, a guide, and sometimes even a second mother. Whether she is older or younger, her presence adds joy, laughter, and support to our everyday moments. A sister shares childhood memories, secrets, dreams, and countless silly fights that later become unforgettable stories. <br>
          <br>
          An elder sister often acts like a protector. She gives advice, helps with problems, and cares deeply even if she doesnâ€™t always show it directly. A younger sister brings energy, fun, and a fresh view of the world. No matter the age difference, the bond between siblings is strong and emotional.<br>
          <br>          
          Sisters celebrate our achievements and stand beside us during failures. They may tease or argue, but their love remains constant. Their role in our life is full of warmth and comfort.<br>
          <br>          
          Even if we are far away due to studies, jobs, or life responsibilities, a sister remains close to the heart. She is someone we can always count on, someone who will always believe in us. Truly, having a sister is like having a lifelong companion who loves you just the way you are.</p><br>
