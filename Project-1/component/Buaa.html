        <p> <b> "Buaa"</b> is a special word in Indian culture that refers to one’s father’s sister. She holds a unique and affectionate place in the family. Unlike a mother, she may not always live in the same house, but her love and care are no less. A Buaa is often a blend of warmth, wisdom, and fun. From childhood, visits to a Buaa’s house are full of joy — delicious homemade food, small gifts, and countless stories that stay in our hearts forever.<br>
        <br>        
        She is more than just a relative. A Buaa can be a second mother, a loyal friend, or even a strict guide when needed. She often takes pride in her brother’s children and treats them like her own. In many families, she plays an important role during festivals, weddings, and family gatherings, bringing people together with her joyful presence.<br>
        <br>        
        As families grow apart due to modern lifestyles, the bond with a Buaa may change, but the love remains constant. Her blessings, advice, and emotional support continue to shape the lives of her nephews and nieces.<br>
        <br>        
        A Buaa is a symbol of unconditional love, strong family values, and timeless connection. She may not be present every day, but her presence is always felt in the heart.</p>
